This project is a full-stack blog post website that combines Bootstrap for the client-side and Flask for the server-side. The website allows users to register, log in, create, edit, and manage their own blog posts.

It uses SQLite for database management, which is lightweight, efficient, and easy to integrate with Flask. The website is hosted on a cloud platform using the nginx web server, ensuring high availability and scalability.
